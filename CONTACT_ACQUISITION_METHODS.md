## 2. Skip Tracing (Free/Cheap Methods)

1. **Google Dorks for Public PDFs**
   - Search: `site:*.gov "[Owner Name]" + "Tax" + "[County Name]" filetype:pdf`
   - Finds: Delinquent tax lists, administrative filings

2. **County Tax Lien Sales Lists**
   - Many counties publish lists of properties with unpaid taxes
   - Often include owner names and sometimes additional contact info

3. **Probate Records Search**
   - Check county surrogate court records
   - Useful for inherited properties
