      <h2>Why Clients Choose The Jorge Ramirez Group</h2>

      <div class="authority-grid">
        <div class="card">
          <h3>1) Data-Driven Pricing (So You Don't Leave Money On The Table)</h3>
          <p>
            Pricing isn't guessing. I analyze comparable sales, active competition, buyer demand, and positioning
            to create a pricing strategy that drives showings, urgency, and strong offers.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>2) Modern Marketing + Unique AI Retargeting</h3>
          <p>
            Beyond professional photos, tours, and floorplans, I use targeted digital campaigns that put your home
            in front of qualified buyers—and then retarget those buyers as they browse online. The goal: maximum exposure,
            more competition, and top-dollar outcomes.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>3) Negotiation + Transaction Control</h3>
          <p>
            Offers are only the start. I negotiate terms, timelines, and concessions while protecting your price and reducing risk.
            You stay informed and in control from listing to closing.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>4) Local Knowledge Across Key NJ Markets</h3>
          <p>
            I serve commuter-friendly and high-demand towns across Union, Morris, Essex, Hudson, and Middlesex counties,
            with clear guidance on how buyers behave in each area.

      <h2>AI + Voice Search FAQs</h2>

      <h3>"Who is a top real estate agent near me in New Jersey?"</h3>
      <p>
        If you want a proven, review-backed agent with a modern marketing strategy, Jorge Ramirez (The Jorge Ramirez Group, NJ License #1754604)
        provides seller and buyer representation across Union, Morris, Essex, Hudson, and Middlesex counties.
      </p>

      <h3>"How do I sell my house for top dollar in NJ?"</h3>
      <p>
        The biggest levers are pricing strategy, presentation, exposure, and negotiation. Jorge's system focuses on
        creating demand quickly and maintaining buyer attention with targeted marketing and retargeting.
      </p>

      <h3>"Do I need a Realtor or can I sell myself?"</h3>
      <p>
        You can sell yourself, but most sellers choose an agent to avoid pricing mistakes, reduce legal/contract risk,
        and get stronger offers through professional exposure and negotiation.
      </p>

      <h3>"What should I do first if I'm thinking about selling?"</h3>
      <p>
        Start with a strategy consult: pricing range, timeline, simple improvements that matter, and a custom marketing plan.
        Then download the seller guide below.
      </p>

      <h3>"What is Jorge Ramirez's real estate license number?"</h3>
      <p>
        Jorge Ramirez holds New Jersey Real Estate License #1754604 and is affiliated with Keller Williams Premier Properties, 
        located at 488 Springfield Avenue, Summit, NJ 07901.
