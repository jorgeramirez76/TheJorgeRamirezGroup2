            <p class="intro" style="font-size: 1.15em; line-height: 1.7; margin: 30px 0;">
                Buying your first home in New Jersey is exciting—and can feel overwhelming. After helping dozens of first-time buyers since 2017, I've noticed the same questions come up again and again. This guide covers what you actually need to know (not what mortgage lenders want you to hear).
            </p>

            <h2>The Reality of Down Payments in NJ</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Myth:</strong> You need 20% down to buy a home.<br>
                <strong>Reality:</strong> Most first-time buyers in NJ put down 3-10%.
            </p>

            <p>Here are your actual options:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>FHA loans:</strong> 3.5% down (credit score 580+)</li>
                <li><strong>Conventional loans:</strong> 3-5% down (better credit needed)</li>
                <li><strong>VA loans:</strong> 0% down (veterans/active military)</li>
                <li><strong>USDA loans:</strong> 0% down (eligible rural areas)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                <strong>What caught you off guard?</strong> Many first-time buyers don't realize that <em>closing costs</em> (2-5% of purchase price) are separate from your down payment. On a $500,000 home with 5% down, expect:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Down payment: $25,000</li>
                <li>Closing costs: $10,000-$25,000</li>
                <li><strong>Total cash needed: $35,000-$50,000</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <h2>New Jersey First-Time Buyer Programs</h2>
            <p>These programs can significantly reduce your upfront costs:</p>

            <h3>1. NJ Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency (NJHMFA)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Down payment assistance up to $10,000</li>
                <li>Income limits apply (varies by county)</li>
                <li>Must complete homebuyer education course</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.nj.gov/dca/hmfa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Learn more at NJHMFA</a></li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Live Where You Work Program</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Up to $5,000 toward closing costs</li>
                <li>Must be a NJ state, county, or municipal employee</li>
                <li>Must work in the municipality where you're buying</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Employer-Assisted Housing Programs</h3>
            <p>Many NJ employers (hospitals, universities, large corporations) offer down payment assistance. Ask your HR department.</p>

            <h2>What Surprises Most First-Time Buyers</h2>
            <p>After 8+ years in NJ real estate, these are the most common "I didn't know that!" moments:</p>

            <h3>1. NJ Property Taxes Are No Joke</h3>
            <p>
                New Jersey has the highest property taxes in the nation. On a $500,000 home in Essex County, expect <strong>$12,000-$18,000/year</strong> in property taxes. Your mortgage payment might be $2,800, but your <em>total monthly housing cost</em> (including taxes and insurance) could be $4,500+.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Use our <a href="../towns.html">town comparison tool</a> to see actual tax rates before you fall in love with a town.</p>

            <h3>2. Inspections Are Optional (But Don't Skip Them)</h3>
            <p>
                In competitive markets, some buyers waive inspections to make their offer more attractive. <strong>Don't do this.</strong> I've seen "move-in ready" homes need $50,000+ in repairs after closing. Budget $400-$800 for a thorough inspection—it's the best money you'll spend.
            </p>

            <h3>3. You're Competing With Investors</h3>
            <p>
                Especially in towns with good schools and train access (Summit, Millburn, Westfield, Maplewood), you're competing against investors and second-home buyers. <strong>Get pre-approved</strong> (not just pre-qualified) before you start touring homes. Sellers take you more seriously.
            </p>

            <h3>4. NYC Commute ≠ NJ Commute</h3>
            <p>
                That "45-minute commute to Manhattan" assumes you're leaving at 10 AM on a Tuesday. During rush hour? Add 30-60 minutes. Visit the town during your actual commute time before you commit.
            </p>

            </p>

            <h3>5. HOA/Condo Fees Are Forever</h3>
            <p>
                Buying a condo or townhouse? That $350/month HOA fee will increase 3-5% per year. In 10 years, it could be $500+/month. Factor this into your long-term budget.
            </p>

            <h2>The Timeline: What to Expect</h2>
            <p>From offer to keys, here's the typical NJ home buying timeline:</p>

            <table style="width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse; margin: 20px 0;">
                <tr style="background: #f5f5f5; font-weight: bold;">
                    <td style="padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #ddd;">Phase</td>
                    <td style="padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #ddd;">Timeframe</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td style="padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #ddd;">Pre-approval</td>
                    <td style="padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #ddd;">1-3 days</td>
                </tr>
                <tr style="background: #fafafa;">
                    <td style="padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #ddd;">House hunting</td>
                    <td style="padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #ddd;">2-8 weeks (avg)</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td style="padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #ddd;">Offer accepted to closing</td>
                    <td style="padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #ddd;">30-45 days</td>
                </tr>
                <tr style="background: #fafafa;">
                    <td style="padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #ddd;">Home inspection</td>
                    <td style="padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #ddd;">Within 10 days of offer</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td style="padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #ddd;">Appraisal</td>
                    <td style="padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #ddd;">7-14 days after inspection</td>
                </tr>
                <tr style="background: #fafafa;">
                    <td style="padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #ddd;">Final walkthrough</td>
                    <td style="padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #ddd;">24-48 hours before closing</td>
                </tr>
            </table>

            <p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Add 2 weeks to any timeline a lender gives you. Things always take longer than expected.</p>

            <h2>Questions Nobody Asks (But Should)</h2>

            <h3>What if I get outbid on every house?</h3>
            <p>
                In hot markets like Summit or Montclair, this happens. Consider:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Expanding to neighboring towns (similar vibe, lower prices)</li>
                <li>Waiving minor contingencies (but NEVER skip inspection)</li>
                <li>Writing a personal letter to sellers (it works more than you'd think)</li>
                <li>Looking at "fixer-uppers" most buyers overlook</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Should I buy now or wait for rates to drop?</h3>
            <p>
                I get this question daily. Here's the truth: <strong>Nobody knows where rates are going.</strong> If you wait 6 months for rates to drop 0.5%, home prices might increase 3-5%. You can always refinance later, but you can't go back in time to buy at today's prices.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>The best time to buy is when you're financially ready and find the right home.</em>
            </p>

            <h3>What's the #1 regret of first-time buyers?</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>"I wish I'd asked more questions."</strong> Don't be embarrassed. This is likely the biggest purchase of your life—ask everything. A good realtor welcomes questions.
            </p>

            <h2>Your Next Steps</h2>
            <ol style="line-height: 1.8;">
                <li><strong>Get pre-approved</strong> (not pre-qualified) from 2-3 lenders—rates vary significantly</li>
                <li><strong>Research towns</strong> using our <a href="../towns.html">comprehensive town guides</a> (schools, taxes, commute)</li>
                <li><strong>Save 6-8% of purchase price</strong> (down payment + closing costs + moving)</li>
                <li><strong>Take a homebuyer education course</strong> (required for some assistance programs, helpful for everyone)</li>
                <li><strong>Talk to a realtor who works in your target towns</strong> (hint: that's me)</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Work With Someone Who Remembers Being a First-Time Buyer</h2>
            <p>
                I bought my first home in New Jersey in 2012. I remember the confusion, the excitement, the "wait, nobody told me about THAT" moments. That's why I actually <em>enjoy</em> working with first-time buyers—you ask great questions and appreciate the guidance.
            </p>

            <p>
                I've been a licensed NJ realtor since 2017, closed 60+ fix-and-flip properties, and helped dozens of first-time buyers find homes they love (and can actually afford). I don't just send you Zillow links—I give you real talk about what to expect.
