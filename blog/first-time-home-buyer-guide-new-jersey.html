      <p><strong>Buying your first home in New Jersey doesn't have to be overwhelming.</strong> I've guided hundreds of first-time buyers through the process, and while NJ's high prices can be intimidating, there are smart strategies and programs that make homeownership achievable.</p>

      <h2>The Complete First-Time Buyer Timeline</h2>

      <h3>6-12 Months Before Buying</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Check credit score (aim for 620+ for FHA, 740+ for best rates)</li>
        <li>Pay down high-interest debt</li>
        <li>Start saving for down payment + closing costs</li>
        <li>Research NJ first-time buyer programs</li>
        <li>Avoid major purchases that affect credit</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3-6 Months Before</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Get pre-approved (not just pre-qualified)</li>
        <li>Research neighborhoods and school districts</li>
        <li>Attend open houses to understand market</li>
        <li>Interview real estate agents</li>
        <li>Gather financial documents (W-2s, tax returns, pay stubs)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Active Buying Phase (2-4 Months)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Tour homes with your agent</li>
        <li>Make offers on properties you love</li>
        <li>Schedule home inspection</li>
        <li>Negotiate repairs or credits</li>
        <li>Finalize mortgage</li>
        <li>Close on your home!</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Down Payment: How Much Do You Really Need?</h2>

      <table>
        <thead><tr><th>Loan Type</th><th>Down Payment</th><th>Credit Score</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr><td>FHA Loan</td><td>3.5%</td><td>580+</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Conventional (Low Down)</td><td>3-5%</td><td>620+</td></tr>
          <tr><td>VA Loan (Veterans)</td><td>0%</td><td>580+</td></tr>
          <tr><td>USDA Loan (Rural)</td><td>0%</td><td>640+</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Conventional (Best Rate)</td><td>20%</td><td>740+</td></tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p><strong>Myth Buster:</strong> You do NOT need 20% down! Most first-time buyers put down 3-5%.</p>

      <h2>Hidden Costs Beyond the Down Payment</h2>

        <li><strong>Total on $500K home:</strong> $10,000-25,000</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>First-Year Homeownership Costs</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Moving expenses: $1,000-3,000</li>

      </ul>

      <h2>The Pre-Approval Process</h2>

      <p><strong>Documents You'll Need:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>2 years tax returns</li>
        <li>2 recent pay stubs</li>
        <li>2 months bank statements</li>
        <li>W-2s (last 2 years)</li>
        <li>Photo ID</li>
        <li>Authorization for credit check</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>What Lenders Look At:</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Credit Score:</strong> Higher = better rates</li>
        <li><strong>Debt-to-Income Ratio:</strong> Keep below 43%</li>
        <li><strong>Employment History:</strong> 2+ years stable income</li>
        <li><strong>Down Payment Source:</strong> Must be documented</li>
        <li><strong>Cash Reserves:</strong> 2-6 months expenses preferred</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>How Much House Can You Afford?</h2>

      <p><strong>The 28/36 Rule:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Housing costs ≤ 28% of gross monthly income</li>
        <li>Total debt ≤ 36% of gross monthly income</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Example:</strong> $100K annual income</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Gross monthly: $8,333</li>
        <li>Max housing payment: $2,333 (28%)</li>
        <li>Max home price: ~$425K (with 5% down, 7% rate)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Common First-Time Buyer Mistakes</h2>

      <h3>1. House Poor Syndrome</h3>
      <p><strong>Mistake:</strong> Buying at the absolute max of your budget</p>
      <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Keep housing payment under 25% of take-home pay</p>

      <h3>2. Skipping Inspection</h3>
      <p><strong>Mistake:</strong> Waiving inspection to compete</p>
      <p><strong>Solution:</strong> NEVER skip inspection in NJ (old housing stock)</p>

      <h3>3. Ignoring Property Taxes</h3>
      <p><strong>Mistake:</strong> Only looking at mortgage payment</p>
      <p><strong>Solution:</strong> NJ has high taxes—factor into monthly budget</p>

      <h3>4. Not Shopping for Mortgage</h3>
      <p><strong>Mistake:</strong> Going with first lender</p>
      <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Get 3-5 quotes, save thousands</p>

      <h3>5. Falling in Love Too Fast</h3>
      <p><strong>Mistake:</strong> Emotional attachment clouds judgment</p>
      <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Walk away if inspection reveals major issues</p>

      <h2>Questions to Ask During Showings</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>How old is the roof? (Replacement costs $10K-25K)</li>
        <li>When was HVAC last serviced/replaced?</li>
        <li>Are there any HOA fees? What do they cover?</li>
        <li>What's the annual property tax?</li>
        <li>How long has the seller owned it?</li>
        <li>Why are they selling?</li>
        <li>Any recent renovations/permits?</li>
        <li>What's included in the sale?</li>
        <li>Average utility costs?</li>
        <li>School district boundaries?</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why Work With a Realtor (It's Free!)</h2>

      <p><strong>Common Myth:</strong> "Using a realtor will cost me money."</p>
