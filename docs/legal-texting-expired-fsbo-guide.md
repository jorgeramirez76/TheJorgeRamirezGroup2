# Legal Guide: Texting Expired Listings & FSBOs
**TCPA Compliance for Real Estate Agents**

⚠️ **DISCLAIMER**: I'm not a lawyer. This is educational information. Consult your broker and/or attorney before implementing any texting campaigns.

## 🚨 THE SHORT ANSWER

**Can you have AI text expired listings/FSBOs?**

**Legally**: Only if you have **prior express written consent** from each recipient.

**Without consent**: NO. You risk $500-$1,500 fines PER TEXT under TCPA (Telephone Consumer Protection Act).

**The loophole most agents try to use doesn't work** (see below).

---

## 📜 TCPA BASICS (What You Must Know)

### What TCPA Prohibits:

**You CANNOT send automated texts (including AI-generated) to cell phones without:**
1. **Prior express written consent** (signed permission)
2. That specifically authorizes text messages
3. From you or your company

### What Counts as "Automated"?

- ✅ AI sending texts (like GHL automation) = AUTOMATED
- ✅ Bulk SMS tools = AUTOMATED
- ✅ Text blasts = AUTOMATED
- ❌ You manually typing each text = NOT automated (allowed without consent)

### Penalties:

- **$500 per violation** (per text sent)
- **$1,500 per willful violation** (if you knew the rules)
- **Class action lawsuits** (FSBOs/expireds can sue collectively)
- **NAR Code of Ethics violations** (potential license issues)

---

## ❌ THE "ESTABLISHED BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP" MYTH

**What agents think:**
"They listed with a broker, so I have an established business relationship. I can text them."

**Why it's wrong:**

1. **EBR doesn't apply to automated texts** to cell phones (TCPA is strict)
2. **Their relationship was with THEIR agent**, not you
3. **Expired ≠ consent** (they didn't give you permission)
4. **FSBO ≠ consent** (public listing doesn't equal permission to text)

**The ONLY EBR exception** that works:
- You already have a relationship with that specific person (past client, referral who gave you their number, etc.)

---

## ✅ HOW TO DO THIS LEGALLY

### Option 1: Get Written Consent First (Best Practice)

**Process:**
1. Send a **physical mailer** to expired/FSBO
2. Include a **consent form**: "Text YES to [your number] to get market updates"
3. When they text YES, **that's written consent**
4. NOW you can use AI/automation to text them

**Consent language (include in mailer):**
```
Text "YES" to (908) 230-7844 to receive text messages about your home's market value and selling strategies. Message and data rates may apply. Reply STOP to opt out anytime.

By texting YES, you agree to receive automated text messages from The Jorge Ramirez Group.
```

**Why this works:**
- They initiated contact (texted YOU first)
- You have written proof of consent
- Fully TCPA compliant

---

### Option 2: Manual Texts Only (No AI, No Automation)

**Process:**
1. Pull expired/FSBO list from Espresso Agent
2. **Manually type** each text (no copy/paste, no automation)
3. Personalize every message
4. Send from your personal phone (not GHL)

**Example manual text:**
```
Hey [Name], saw your home at [Address] was listed with [Agent] last year. Still looking to sell? I've sold 3 homes on your street in the last 6 months. - Jorge
```

**Why this works:**
- Not automated (you're typing each one)
- TCPA doesn't apply to individual manual texts
- Still requires compliance with DNC list (see below)

**Downside:**
- Time-consuming (10-15 texts/hour max)
- Doesn't scale
- Can't use AI/automation

---

### Option 3: Call First, Get Verbal Consent, Then Text

**Process:**
1. **Call** the expired/FSBO (calls have different TCPA rules)
2. During call: "Can I text you information about [topic]?"
3. If they say YES, **note it in your CRM**
4. NOW you can text them (consent obtained)

**Script for call:**
```
"Hi [Name], this is Jorge Ramirez with Keller Williams. I see your home at [Address] was on the market recently. I've sold several homes in your neighborhood and wanted to reach out. Would it be okay if I texted you some recent sales data for your area?"
```

**If they say YES:**
- Follow up with text: "Thanks for the chat! Here's the info I mentioned: [link]"
- Add to GHL with tag: "Consent: Verbal (Date)"
- You can now automate follow-ups

**Why this works:**
- You got consent (even verbal counts for follow-up)
- TCPA allows calls to businesses + some residential (see below)
- Builds rapport first

---

## 📞 NATIONAL DO NOT CALL (DNC) REGISTRY

**Separate rule from TCPA** (but also important):

### Can you call expired/FSBOs?

**YES, with conditions:**

1. **Check DNC list first**: scrubdnc.com or donotcall.gov
2. **If they're on DNC**: You can ONLY call if:
   - You have an established business relationship, OR
   - They gave you written permission

**Expired listing exception:**
- If they listed in last 18 months with ANY agent, you CAN call (even if on DNC)
- Considered "business inquiry" not "unsolicited"

**FSBO exception:**
- Advertising their home = "business inquiry"
- You CAN call (even if on DNC)

**After you call:**
- If they say "don't call again" → add to YOUR DNC list (must honor)
- If they're interested → get consent to text

## 🎯 RECOMMENDED COMPLIANT STRATEGY

**Week 1: Physical Mail + SMS Opt-In**

1. Pull expired/FSBO list from Espresso Agent
2. Send **physical mailer** (postcard or letter):
   - "Your home didn't sell. Here's why + what to do next"
   - Include: "Text INFO to (908) 230-7844 for a free market analysis"
   - Include consent language (see above)

3. When they text "INFO":
   - **GHL automation captures it**
   - Tags: "Lead Source: Expired Mailer" + "Consent: Yes"
   - NOW you can use AI to reply

**Week 2: Manual Calls to Non-Responders**

4. Call everyone who DIDN'T text (not on DNC)
5. During call: Ask if you can text them info
6. If YES → add to GHL, automate follow-up

**Week 3+: AI Nurture Sequence (Only for Consented Leads)**

7. GHL automation texts:
   - Day 1: "Thanks for reaching out! Here's your market analysis: [link]"
   - Day 3: "Quick question: what was the biggest challenge when your home was listed?"
   - Day 7: "I've sold 3 homes in your neighborhood recently. Want to see what they sold for?"
   - Day 14: "Still thinking about relisting? Happy to chat anytime."

**Why this works:**
- Fully TCPA compliant (consent obtained)
- Scales (automation after consent)
- Builds your list legally
- Higher response rate (they initiated contact)

---

## 💬 GHL AUTOMATION SETUP (After Consent Obtained)

**Workflow: Expired/FSBO SMS Nurture**

**Trigger**: Tag added "Consent: Yes" + "Lead Type: Expired"

**Day 1** (Immediate):
```
Hey [First Name], thanks for texting! I'm pulling recent sales data for homes near [Address]. I'll have it ready in the next hour. Quick Q: What was the main reason your home didn't sell? - Jorge
```

**Day 3** (If they replied):
```
[First Name], based on what you said, here's what I'd do differently: [personalized advice]. Want to hop on a 10-min call to discuss? - Jorge
```

**Day 7** (If no reply):
```
Hey [First Name], just wanted to follow up. I've helped 5 sellers in [Town] this year who had similar situations. No pressure, but if you want to chat, I'm here. - Jorge
```

**Day 14** (Final nudge):
```
[First Name], I'll stop bugging you :) But if you decide to relist, I'd love to help. Here's my calendar: [link]. - Jorge
```

**If they reply STOP**:
- GHL auto-unsubscribes them
- TCPA requires immediate opt-out (your system must handle this)

---

## 🚩 RED FLAGS (Don't Do This)

❌ **Bulk texting without consent** ("I'll just send 100 texts and see what happens")  
→ Risk: $50,000-$150,000 in fines if even 1 person reports you

❌ **Buying phone numbers from lead list**  
→ They didn't consent to YOU specifically

❌ **Using "established business relationship" as excuse**  
→ Doesn't apply to automated texts

❌ **Assuming "they listed publicly, so it's fair game"**  
→ TCPA doesn't care, still need consent

❌ **Texting from unverified number**  
→ Carriers block spam numbers, you'll get blacklisted

❌ **Ignoring STOP requests**  
→ Instant TCPA violation, $1,500 per text after that

---

## ✅ COMPLIANCE CHECKLIST

**Before you send ANY automated texts:**

- [ ] Recipient gave **written consent** (text opt-in, form signature, etc.)
- [ ] Consent was **specific to text messages** (not just email)
- [ ] Consent was to **your company** (not another agent)
- [ ] Your GHL account has **proper opt-out handling** (auto-stop on "STOP")
- [ ] You're using **10DLC registered number** (GHL should handle this)
- [ ] Your texts include **your name + company** (not anonymous)
- [ ] Your texts have **opt-out instructions** ("Reply STOP to unsubscribe")
- [ ] You **keep records of consent** (for 4 years minimum)

**If you can't check ALL boxes → Don't send automated texts.**

---

## 💡 ALTERNATIVE: RINGLESS VOICEMAIL (Also Risky)

**What it is**: Drops voicemail without phone ringing

**Is it legal?**
- **Debated** (courts are split)
- Some say it's not a "call" so TCPA doesn't apply
- Others say it's still automated contact = requires consent
- **FCC hasn't issued clear ruling**

**My recommendation**: **Avoid it**
- Too much legal uncertainty
- Recipients find it creepy
- Low ROI (most ignore)
- Not worth the risk

---

## 🎯 WHAT I'D DO IF I WERE YOU

**Recommended Approach:**

**Month 1: Build Consented List**
1. Send physical mailers to 100 expired/FSBOs
2. Include text opt-in: "Text INFO to (908) 230-7844"
3. Expect 5-15% opt-in rate (5-15 people)
4. Manually call the rest (check DNC first)
5. During calls, ask: "Can I text you market data?"

**Month 2: Automate Follow-Up (Only for Consented)**
6. Set up GHL workflow for opt-ins
7. AI texts nurture sequence (Day 1, 3, 7, 14)
8. Track conversions (texts → calls → appointments → listings)

**Month 3: Scale**
9. If it's working, send 500 mailers/month
10. Build your consented list to 50-100 people
11. Now AI automation is worth it (volume)

**Expected Results:**
- 100 mailers → 10 opt-ins → 2 appointments → 1 listing
- Cost: $100 mailers + $50 GHL
- Revenue: $15,000 commission
- ROI: 100X

## 📞 SAFER ALTERNATIVE: COLD CALLING (Still Allowed)

**If texting feels too risky, calling is clearer:**

1. **Pull expired/FSBO list**
2. **Scrub against DNC** (federal + NJ)
3. **Call manually** (you talking, not automated dialer)
4. **During call**: Build rapport, offer value, ask to text

**Call script:**
```
"Hi [Name], Jorge Ramirez with Keller Williams. I see your home at [Address] was on the market with [Agent]. I've sold several homes in your neighborhood recently and wanted to reach out. Do you have 2 minutes?"

[If yes:]
"Great. I pulled recent sales data for your street. Would it be helpful if I texted you a quick summary, or would you prefer I email it?"

[If they say TEXT:]
"Perfect. What's the best number?" [Confirm consent, now you can text]
```

**Why this works:**
- Calls have different (clearer) rules than texts
- You can still use AI AFTER getting consent on call
- Builds relationship first (higher conversion)

## 🛡️ HOW TO PROTECT YOURSELF

**If you DO automate texts (with consent):**

1. **Keep detailed records:**
   - Who opted in
   - How they opted in (text, call, form)
   - Date/time of consent
   - Proof (screenshot, recording, form submission)

2. **Include in every automated text:**
   - Your name + company
   - Opt-out instructions ("Reply STOP anytime")

3. **Honor opt-outs immediately:**
   - STOP, UNSUBSCRIBE, CANCEL, QUIT → all trigger auto-unsubscribe
   - No texts after that (TCPA requirement)

4. **Use a registered 10DLC number:**
   - GHL should handle this (A2P 10DLC registration)
   - Verify with GHL support
   - Unregistered = carrier blocks you

5. **Don't text after 9pm local time:**
   - TCPA prohibits calls/texts outside 8am-9pm
   - GHL should have "quiet hours" setting

## ✅ MY RECOMMENDATION FOR YOU

**Step 1: Talk to Your Broker**
- Show them this document
- Ask: "What's our office policy on texting expired/FSBOs?"
- Get written approval

**Step 2: Start with Mailers (Legal, Safe, Effective)**
- 100-200 mailers/month to expired/FSBOs
- Include text opt-in
- Build your consented list

**Step 3: Call Non-Responders (Manual, Not Automated)**
- Scrub DNC first
- Call, build rapport, ask to text
- Add to GHL after consent

**Step 4: Automate Follow-Up (Only for Consented)**
- GHL SMS workflow
- AI nurture sequence
- Track ROI

**This way:**
- ✅ Fully TCPA compliant
- ✅ Builds long-term asset (consented list)
- ✅ Scales over time
- ✅ No legal risk
- ✅ Higher conversion (people opted in = warmer)

---

## 🚨 FINAL WARNING

**DO NOT:**
- Bulk text expireds/FSBOs without consent
- Assume "public listing = permission to text"
- Use "established business relationship" excuse
- Ignore STOP requests
- Text without 10DLC registration

**ONE complaint to FCC = Investigation**  
**ONE class action lawsuit = $500,000+ in fines**

**It's not worth it. Do it the right way.**

## 💬 QUESTIONS FOR YOUR BROKER

**Before implementing, ask:**

1. "What's our office policy on texting expired listings?"
2. "Do we have a compliant opt-in process I should use?"
3. "Should I run my text templates by you first?"
4. "Do we have E&O insurance coverage for TCPA violations?"
5. "Can you connect me with our legal counsel to review this?"

---

**Bottom line**: You CAN use AI to text expireds/FSBOs, but ONLY after getting their consent first. Start with mailers → build your consented list → then automate. It's slower but legal and sustainable.
