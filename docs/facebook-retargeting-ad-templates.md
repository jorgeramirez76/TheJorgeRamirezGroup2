#### Ad 1A: Curiosity Hook

**Primary Text**:  
```
Most people who download our seller's guide tell me one section changed how they think about listing their home.

### Campaign 2: Downloaded Guide (Days 4-10)

**Audience**: Downloaded Seller's Guide 4-10 days ago

#### Ad 2A: Consequence Question
**Headline**: What happens if you wait another 6 months?  
**Primary Text**:  
```
I'm not saying you need to sell NOW. But I'm curious:

If you wait until summer/fall to list, what happens in the meantime?

• Do you end up doing more repairs?
• Do property taxes increase again?
• Do interest rates change?
• Does the market shift?

Not trying to pressure you—just wondering what you're weighing right now. If you want to talk through it, text me: 908-230-7844

**CTA Button**: Send Message  
**Image**: Calendar or clock with text "Timing matters"

#### Ad 2B: Problem Awareness
**Headline**: Most sellers underestimate this by 30%  
**Primary Text**:  
```
When you downloaded the seller's guide, you saw the section on closing costs.

Here's what catches people off guard:

The average NJ seller budgets $15K for closing costs... and ends up paying $22K.

Why? Title insurance, attorney fees, prorated taxes, HOA payoffs, repairs from inspection.

Want to know your actual number before you list?

I'll send you a personalized net proceeds estimate—free, no strings. Just text me your address: 908-230-7844

#### Ad 2C: Solution Awareness

**Primary Text**:  
```
You've seen the "How We Sell" page. You know we use AI targeting, YouTube ads, and Facebook retargeting.

But does it actually work?

Last month: 12 listings, average 23 days on market.  
This month so far: 3 sold, 2 under contract.

The difference? We don't wait for buyers to stumble across your listing. We hunt them down.

Curious how that would work for your neighborhood?

**Audience**: Downloaded Seller's Guide 11-30 days ago

#### Ad 3A: Soft Re-Engagement
**Headline**: Still thinking about it?  
**Primary Text**:  
```
You downloaded our seller's guide a few weeks ago.

Maybe you're still weighing your options. Maybe life got busy. Maybe you're not ready yet.

That's totally fine.

But if you have questions—about pricing, timing, what to fix before listing, whatever—I'm here.

No pitch. Just honest answers.

**Primary Text**:

Quick market snapshot for Union/Essex County homeowners:

📊 Inventory: Down 8% vs. last month  
⏱️ Average days on market: 31 days  
💰 Median sale price: Up 3.2%  
🏡 Homes selling above ask: 42%

What does this mean for you?

If you're thinking about listing in the next 3-6 months, now's the time to start planning. Spring market is heating up fast.

#### Ad 3C: Case Study
**Headline**: "We got $65K more than Zillow's estimate"  
**Primary Text**:  
```
Real story from a Summit seller last month:

Zillow said: $725K  
Redfin said: $730K  
We listed at: $779K  
It sold for: $795K

How? Strategic pricing + aggressive marketing to buyers who were ALREADY looking for homes like theirs.

Not every home will beat estimates by that much. But most sellers leave money on the table because they don't know what buyers are actually willing to pay.

Curious what your home is really worth?
