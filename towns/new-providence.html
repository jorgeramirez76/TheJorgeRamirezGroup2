      <h3>5. How competitive is the New Providence real estate market?</h3>
      <p>The market is quite competitive due to excellent schools and limited inventory. Well-priced homes often receive multiple offers within days.

      <h3>6. What is the property tax rate in New Providence?</h3>
      <p>The effective tax rate is approximately 2.2% of assessed value. For a $800,000 home, you can expect annual taxes around $17,600. While not the lowest in the state, the taxes reflect the excellent school system and community services that make New Providence desirable.</p>

      <h3>7. Is New Providence walkable?</h3>
      <p>The downtown area around the train station is walkable, with homes within walking distance of shops, restaurants, and the library. However, most residents use cars for daily errands.

      <h3>10. Are there any historic homes in New Providence?</h3>
      <p>While New Providence doesn't have as many historic homes as some neighboring towns, there are charming older properties, particularly in the downtown area near Central Avenue. These homes often date to the early-to-mid 20th century and offer character and craftsmanship not found in newer construction.</p>

      <h3>11. What should I know about buying a home in New Providence?</h3>
      <p>Buyers should be prepared for a competitive market. Get pre-approved for a mortgage before starting your search. Understand that properties in the most desirable school zones command premiums. Consider the commute to NYC if that's relevant to your lifestyle. Work with an agent who knows the local market intimately.</p>

      <h3>12. What should sellers know about the New Providence market?</h3>
      <p>Sellers benefit from strong demand driven by excellent schools. Well-prepared homes that are priced correctly often sell quickly and may receive multiple offers.

      <h3>16. Can I find new construction in New Providence?</h3>
      <p>New construction is limited in New Providence due to the town's mature nature. Most "new" homes are actually tear-down rebuilds on existing lots. These custom-built homes typically range from $1.2-1.8M and offer modern amenities with the benefit of established neighborhoods.</p>

      <h3>17. What private school options are available nearby?</h3>
      <p>While the public schools are excellent, nearby private options include Kent Place School (girls, Summit), Oak Knoll School (girls, Summit), Pingry School (Basking Ridge/Martinsville), and Delbarton School (boys, Morristown). These are all within a 15-25 minute drive.</p>

      <h3>18. Is New Providence a good place to retire?</h3>
      <p>While primarily known as a family town, New Providence appeals to some empty nesters who appreciate the quiet, safe environment and the ability to downsize within the community they've called home. However, those seeking more active adult communities might prefer neighboring towns with more condominium options.</p>

      <h3>19. What is the food and restaurant scene like?</h3>
      <p>New Providence has a modest but quality selection of local restaurants including Italian, Asian, and American options. Many residents enjoy the convenience of nearby Summit for more extensive dining options. The town has a family-friendly vibe with restaurants catering to casual dining.</p>
