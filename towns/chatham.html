      <p>Many Chatham Borough homes date to the early 1900s-1950s. While charming, they may need updates to electrical, plumbing, or HVAC systems. I always recommend thorough inspections and can connect you with qualified local inspectors.</p>

      <h3>Why should I choose you as my Chatham Realtor?</h3>
      <p>I bring 8+ years of experience, deep knowledge of both Borough and Township markets, proven results in luxury home sales, and a marketing system that positions your home in front of the right buyers. I understand what makes Chatham special and how to communicate that value.</p>
