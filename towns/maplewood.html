      <h2>Home Styles & Housing Stock in Maplewood</h2>
      <p>Maplewood is famous for its beautiful architecture, particularly its distinctive Tudor homes. The town's housing stock dates primarily from the early 1900s through the 1960s, with the most distinctive homes built during the 1920s and 1930s when Maplewood was developing as a commuter suburb for Manhattan professionals.</p>
      
      <h3>Architectural Styles</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Tudor Homes:</strong> Maplewood's signature style – distinctive half-timbered homes built primarily in the 1920s-1930s. These homes feature steeply pitched gable roofs, elaborate chimneys, decorative half-timbering, and leaded glass windows. The Tudor Revival architecture gives Maplewood its distinctive character and is highly sought after by buyers who appreciate historic charm. Many of these homes have been lovingly updated while preserving original details like arched doorways, wrought iron fixtures, and exposed beams.</li>

        <li><strong>Victorian Homes:</strong> Beautiful historic properties, particularly near the village area, featuring ornate details, wraparound porches, and gingerbread trim. These homes appeal to buyers who love period character and unique architectural elements.</li>
        <li><strong>Split-Level and Ranch Homes:</strong> Found in neighborhoods developed in the 1950s-1960s, these homes offer more open floor plans and are popular with buyers seeking single-level living or more modern layouts.</li>
        <li><strong>Contemporary & Modern:</strong> Some newer construction and renovations featuring modern design, clean lines, and open-concept living spaces that appeal to buyers seeking a more current aesthetic.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Lot Sizes and Property Features</h3>
      <p><strong>Typical Lot Sizes:</strong> Maplewood lots typically range from 0.15 to 0.3 acres, with tree-lined streets creating a lush, suburban feel. Many properties feature mature landscaping, established gardens, and backyard spaces perfect for entertaining or children's play. The town's commitment to preserving its tree canopy means most homes enjoy shade and privacy from mature oak, maple, and sycamore trees.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Common Property Features:</strong> Many Maplewood homes include front porches that encourage neighborly interaction, detached garages (some converted to studios or offices), basements suitable for finishing, and architectural details like built-in cabinetry, fireplaces with original mantels, and hardwood floors. The town's historic preservation efforts help maintain the character that makes Maplewood so appealing.</p>

      <p>The towns share a school district but have different characters. Maplewood is often seen as more residential and family-focused, while South Orange has a slightly more urban feel with its own downtown. Both are diverse and progressive.</p>
      
      <h3>14. Are there any new construction homes in Maplewood?</h3>
      <p>New construction is limited due to the town's established nature. Most "new" homes are extensive renovations or rebuilds of existing properties. The town prioritizes historic preservation.</p>
      
      <h3>15. What's the best neighborhood for families?</h3>
      <p>The DeHart/Wyoming area and Memorial Park area are particularly popular with families due to proximity to schools and parks. However, all neighborhoods are family-friendly with active community involvement.</p>
      
      <h3>16. How are the restaurants in Maplewood?</h3>
      <p>The village has a growing restaurant scene including The Woodland, Arturo's for Italian, and various cafes. Many residents also enjoy nearby options in South Orange, Millburn, and Summit.</p>
      
      <h3>17. Is Maplewood LGBTQ+ friendly?</h3>
      <p>Absolutely. Maplewood is recognized as one of the most LGBTQ+ friendly suburbs in America. The town has an active LGBTQ+ community, inclusive schools, and anti-discrimination protections.</p>
      
      <h3>18. What should I know about buying a Tudor home?</h3>
      <p>Tudors are beautiful but require specialized maintenance. I work with inspectors familiar with historic homes and can connect you with contractors experienced in preserving period details while updating systems.</p>
      
      <h3>19. Are there any areas to avoid in Maplewood?</h3>
      <p>Maplewood doesn't really have "bad" neighborhoods. The entire town is safe and well-maintained. Price points vary by location relative to the train and specific architectural appeal.</p>
      
      <h3>20. What should I know about flood zones?</h3>
      <p>Most of Maplewood is not in a flood zone, but some properties near streams or low-lying areas may have flood considerations. I check flood maps for any property you're considering and can explain insurance implications.</p>
