            <h2>Why Sellers Struggle in Scotch Plains</h2>
            <p>Many homeowners in Scotch Plains underestimate the importance of strategic pricing and presentation. Overpricing a home can cause it to sit on the market and ultimately sell for less than it could have. Staging and minor repairs are often overlooked, yet they significantly impact buyer perception and offer strength.</p>
            <p>Limited exposure is another challenge. Relying solely on MLS or a yard sign does not reach the modern buyer. Professional marketing, including high-resolution photos, virtual tours, and targeted online advertising, is essential in today’s competitive market.</p>
            <p>Timing can be critical. Without understanding local market trends and buyer demand, sellers may list during a slow period. Our expertise ensures you list at the right time to maximize interest and offers.</p>

            <h2>Our Proven Process</h2>
            <p>We start with data-driven pricing to ensure your home is positioned competitively from day one. We analyze comparable sales, current inventory, and buyer demand to recommend a price that attracts attention and maximizes your return.</p>
            <p>Next, we showcase your property with professional marketing: photography, virtual tours, floorplans, and targeted advertising across social media and major real estate platforms. Your home will stand out from the competition and reach the right buyers.</p>
            <p>Finally, we leverage expert negotiation skills and Keller Williams’ powerful network to secure the best terms and ensure a smooth transaction. From listing to closing, we guide you every step of the way.</p><!-- Added paragraph about our unique AI-powered marketing system -->
            <p>In addition, I’ve developed a unique marketing system that uses AI to position your Scotch Plains home in front of qualified buyers who are actively looking for a property like yours. We then retarget those buyers every time they go online—creating maximum exposure, more competition, and ultimately top dollar. This is a system most agents simply do not have.</p>
