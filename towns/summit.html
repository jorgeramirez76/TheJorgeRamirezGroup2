      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr><th>Metric</th><th>Value</th></tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>NYC Commute</h2>
      <p>Summit's train station is a major selling point for NYC professionals. The NJ Transit Morris &amp; Essex Line provides direct "Midtown Direct" service to Penn Station.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Summit to Penn Station (Express):</strong> 39-40 minutes, peak hours, ~$14 one-way</li>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Property Taxes</h2>
      <p>New Jersey has among the highest property taxes in the nation, and Summit is no exception. However, Summit enjoys the lowest effective tax rate in Union County at approximately 1.55%. Because home values are high, the actual tax bills remain substantial.</p>
      <table>
        <thead><tr><th>Home Value</th><th>Estimated Annual Tax</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr><td>$800,000</td><td>~$12,400</td></tr>

      </table>
      <p>Taxes are due quarterly on the first of February, May, August, and November. Payment options include online, by mail, or in person at City Hall (512 Springfield Avenue).</p>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Downtown Summit: Dining, Shopping &amp; Lifestyle</h2>
      <p>Summit's downtown along Springfield Avenue is arguably the city's most endearing feature-and a genuine competitive advantage in the real estate market. Unlike many suburban towns with strip-mall commercial areas, Summit offers a walkable, vibrant downtown core.</p>
      <p>The downtown takes on a decidedly "Old World" feel with tall trees shading the sidewalks, boutique storefronts, and outdoor café seating. Springfield Avenue and Maple Street host upscale boutiques, diverse dining (from the historic Summit Diner to upscale spots like Roots Steakhouse and Huntley Taverne), fitness centers, and professional services.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Parks, Recreation &amp; Outdoor Life</h2>
      <p>Open space has been essential to Summit's identity since the city was founded. Residents enjoy extensive park facilities and access to the Watchung Reservation.</p>
      <ul>

      <h2>Selling Your Summit Home: Strategy Guide</h2>
      <p>If you're considering selling in Summit, strategic positioning is essential. Based on current market activity, buyers prioritize:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Updated kitchens and bathrooms with modern finishes.</li>
        <li>Open floor plans for better flow.</li>
        <li>Outdoor space-yards, patios, and landscaping matter.</li>
        <li>Move-in condition-turnkey properties attract the most competitive offers.</li>
        <li>Walkability to downtown and the train station.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Pricing strategy: Summit's market punishes overpricing. Well-priced homes receive multiple offers within days; overpriced homes sit and eventually sell below true market value. Work with an agent who knows Summit's micro-markets to position your home correctly.</p>
      <p>Preparation &amp; presentation: Address deferred maintenance, stage key rooms professionally, invest in professional photography and video, and highlight unique features and upgrades. Effective marketing should reach both local buyers and NYC-based professionals using digital advertising, social media, print exposure, open houses, and networking.</p>
